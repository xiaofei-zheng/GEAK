# ROCm Libraries Reference

## Installation

Libraries listed below are pre-installed in the current environment under `/opt/rocm-*/` or `/opt/rocm`.
Use `ls /opt/rocm-*/include/` to discover installed headers and the exact ROCm version.

## Source Code

All library source code is in one monorepo. To obtain it:

```bash
# Clone to ~/.cache (shallow clone, latest commit only)
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/ROCm/rocm-libraries.git ~/.cache/rocm-libraries
```

After cloning, each library's source code is at `~/.cache/rocm-libraries/projects/<library>/`.

## Core — Kernel Optimization

| Library | Local Path | Description |
|---------|-----------|-------------|

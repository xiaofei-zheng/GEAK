## Summary

- **Total kernel categories in Path_vllm.txt**: 39
- **Reports created**: 17
- **Direct coverage (✅)**: 17 categories
- **Indirect coverage (⚠️)**: 17 categories (covered within other reports)
- **Not covered (❌)**: 5 categories

### Not Covered Categories (Lower Priority)
1. **FP4/NVFP4 Quantization** - Very new (Blackwell), limited commit history
2. **GGUF Quantization** - Compatibility layer for llama.cpp models
3. **Machete Quantization** - Specialized mixed-precision kernel
4. **W4A8 Quantization** - Niche quantization format
5. **Hadamard Kernels** - Auxiliary transform for quantization

### Coverage Notes
- Most kernel categories are covered either directly or as part of related reports
- Categories marked ⚠️ share optimization patterns with their parent reports
- Infrastructure code (CUTLASS extensions) provides utilities rather than standalone kernels

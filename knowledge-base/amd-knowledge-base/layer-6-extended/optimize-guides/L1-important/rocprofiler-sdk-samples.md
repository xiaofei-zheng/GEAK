# ROCprofiler-SDK Samples

## Overview

The ROCprofiler-SDK provides sample programs designed to demonstrate the profiler's functionality in practical scenarios.

## Finding Samples

Sample programs and tools are distributed through the ROCm installation:

- **Sample programs location:** `/opt/rocm/share/rocprofiler-sdk/samples`
- **rocprofv3 tool location:** `/opt/rocm/bin`

## Building Samples

To compile the samples from any directory, execute these commands:

```bash
cmake -B build-rocprofiler-sdk-samples /opt/rocm/share/rocprofiler-sdk/samples -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/opt/rocm
cmake --build build-rocprofiler-sdk-samples --target all --parallel 8
```

## Running Samples

After building, navigate to the build directory and run the test suite:

```bash
cd build-rocprofiler-sdk-samples
ctest -V
```

The `-V` flag produces verbose output, showing detailed information throughout test execution.

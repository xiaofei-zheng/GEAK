# GPU Programming Patterns

## Common GPU Programming Challenges

GPU programming introduces unique obstacles absent from conventional CPU development:

- **Memory coherence**: "GPUs lack robust cache coherence mechanisms, requiring careful coordination when multiple threads access shared memory."

- **Race conditions**: "Concurrent memory access requires atomic operations or careful algorithm design."

- **Irregular parallelism**: Real-world algorithms frequently exhibit varying quantities of parallel work throughout iterations.

- **CPU-GPU communication**: Data transfer costs between host and device necessitate optimization.

## Tutorial Overview

This collection addresses essential patterns for efficient parallel computation:

- **Two-dimensional kernels**: Processing grid-structured information such as matrices and images.

- **Stencil operations**: "Updating array elements based on neighboring values."

- **Atomic operations**: "Ensuring data integrity during concurrent memory access."

- **Multi-kernel applications**: "Coordinating multiple GPU kernels to solve complex problems."

- **CPU-GPU cooperation**: Distributing work strategically between processors.

### Prerequisites

Recommended foundational knowledge includes:

- C/C++ programming fundamentals
- Parallel programming concepts familiarity
- Installed HIP runtime environment
- GPU architecture understanding (optional but beneficial)

### Getting Started

Each tutorial functions independently, though sequential study is suggested:

1. Start with two-dimensional kernels for basic GPU thread organization
2. Progress to stencil operations for neighborhood dependencies
3. Study atomic operations for concurrent access patterns
4. Explore multi-kernel programming for complex algorithms
5. Review CPU-GPU cooperation for mixed-parallelism workloads
